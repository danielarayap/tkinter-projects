"""
This is an app using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter library. It's a user interface in which we can view three buttons: Rock, Paper,
and Scissors. Users of the app can press any button to make their choice.

In this game, we will be playing against the computer, that can also select its choice automatically (random). It is a
game with three choices: rock, paper, and scissors. Two players can play this game at a time. Each one has to choose
from the three options available.

So, both the user and the computer will choose their options. And then, we will apply the following rules.
    If the user chooses rock, and computer chooses scissors, rock wins.
    If the user chooses rock, and computer chooses paper, paper wins.
    If the user chooses scissors, and computer chooses paper, scissors wins.
    If both the choices are the same, then no one will win. Both the user and the computer will not get any points.
