"""
It is a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line that grows in length, with the line itself being a primary
obstacle.

In this game, the player controls a snake. The intention is to eat as many apples as possible. Each time the snake eats
an apple, its body grows. The snake must avoid the walls and its own body.

Even though it is a fun game, you might need to write a lot of code to complete the project. You need to take care of a
lot of things while developing this game. But, it will teach you a lot of things as a programmer.

So, if you are interested in doing this project, then check out this article. I hope it will help you to create a snake
game by yourself. http://zetcode.com/tkinter/snake/
