This software is the restaurant management system, which is having a great looking user interface made with the Tkinter
widgets.

This app can be used by restaurants to calculate the bill of their customers effortlessly. You can enter the number of
each item ordered by the customer and then click a button.

Then, the Python program behind the software will do all the calculations and will show you the total amount,
along with the service charge, state tax, etc. This app will help restaurant owners a lot in doing their math.

The app also contains a separate calculator that the restaurant owners can use for doing some essential calculations.

If you are interested in doing this project, then try out this project. You can use this video tutorial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqC9tioGCi0 for help. I hope it will help you. Again, this is a little bit advanced
project using Tkinter. So, it will be worth doing it if you want to improve your programming skills.
