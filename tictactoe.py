Tic-tac-toe (Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3
grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

You need some strategy, tactics, and observation to win this game. Now, let’s use some programming strategies and
tactics to automate this game so that we can play it on our computer.

You can use this app to play the game with your friends, without using paper and pen. Also, doing this project will make
you more confident in your programming skills.

If you want to build this game using Python, then I’ve found a video that will help you do that quickly. Check out this
video and create a beautiful game.
