"""
A login and register system is a fundamental thing that you should learn, no matter which language or framework you are
learning. You can also use Tkinter to create some neat graphical user interface and build a login system on that.

So, in this project, you will be to learn how to create a tiny login and register system with Python. You will be
writing the code which will allow users of the app to create their accounts on the software.

Later, these users who already have created the account can log on to the software directly. It is a great feature to
have for any software.

The project will also show you how to implement basic features into the software using modules such as OS for carrying
out functions with the operating system.

This project will give you a good understanding of how the login and register system works. We all use these systems on
various mobile applications and web applications.

This project will teach you what is happening behind when we register and login on a system like this. It will help you
when you learn other web frameworks and build your applications in the future.

If you’re interested in doing this project, then I’ve got a resource for you, which will help you. Check out this
three-part YouTube video series https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-deSpgtIG0, which I found when I was doing the
research. I hope it will help you to do a decent project using Tkinter.
